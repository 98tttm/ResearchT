## Project Description

This project explores stock price prediction using machine learning models—Linear Regression and Random Forest. The dataset used for this analysis (`Adata.csv`) contains stock closing prices along with their associated features. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these models in predicting future stock prices.

### Dataset

- **`Adata.csv`**: The dataset contains stock market data, including the closing price and possibly other financial indicators.

## Files and Directories

- **`run_pseudo_code.py`**: Contains the implementation of the Linear Regression and Random Forest models, as well as the feature extraction logic.
- **`Test_Set_Performance_and_Graph.py`**: This script evaluates model performance on a test dataset, calculating key metrics like R-squared, and generates a comparison graph of actual vs. predicted closing prices.
- **`Adata.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test script to evaluate model performance:
   ```sh
   python Test_Set_Performance_and_Graph.py
   ```

## Model Overview

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet powerful machine learning model used for predicting continuous values.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Results

The repository includes a visualization comparing actual stock closing prices with the predictions made by the Linear Regression and Random Forest models. The chart showcases the accuracy of each model in predicting real stock prices.
